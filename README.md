# Sample Telegram Bots

Currently only includes one bot, SampleBot.  It's a basic echoing bot.

To use it, get an access token from [@BotFather](https://web.telegram.org/#/im?p=@BotFather) and replace `ACCESS_TOKEN_GOES_HERE` with it.  You also need to resolve the maven dependencies.

This code is used in my guide to getting started with telegram bots [here.](http://menasheh.peromsik.net/getprogramming/headfirst-jump-into-telegram-bots-java-method/)
